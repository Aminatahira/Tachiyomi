                At Tachiyomi, our mission is to democratize access to manga
                literature and provide readers worldwide with a powerful, free,
                and open-source platform that respects both creators and
                consumers. We believe that everyone should have access to the
                stories they love, regardless of their location, financial
                situation, or technical expertise.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                Founded in 2015, Tachiyomi emerged from a simple observation:
                existing manga reading applications were either too limited, too
                expensive, or filled with intrusive advertisements that
                detracted from the reading experience. Our founders, passionate
                manga readers themselves, recognized the need for a solution
                that prioritized user experience, privacy, and community
                engagement above all else.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                Today, Tachiyomi serves millions of users across 150+ countries,
                offering access to thousands of manga sources while maintaining
                our core principles of being completely free, open-source, and
                advertisement-free. We continue to innovate and expand our
                platform based on community feedback and technological
                advancements.
